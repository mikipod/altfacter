AlterNative Facter
==================

Based on https://github.com/puppetlabs/facter
A mostly random generator of AlterNative facts. Same as real server facts, except different and more fun.

Soon to follow
--------------
* Random bug solver
* Successfull unit test responder
* Constant size lossy compression utility, your files will now always fit where you need them to!


Add arrays of fun to the `@altfacts` hash inside the AltFacter class (maybe that should be loaded from yaml or json or something...who knows).  Then run it and see what your system REALLY is made of. The number stuff *should* take care of itself.
